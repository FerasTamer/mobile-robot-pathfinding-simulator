# mobile-robot-pathfinding-simulator
This is an interactive Python-based simulation that demonstrates autonomous robot navigation using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The project combines grid-based navigation, obstacle avoidance, and differential drive robot kinematics to create a realistic and educational robotics simulation.
